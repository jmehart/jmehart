### Hi there, I'm Jaimie ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­  I'm currently a student at Nashville Software School and I have a background in audio engineering, 12 years as a radio DJ, and I've been a freelance web content writer and WordPress designer for 5 years. I'm eager to combine my passion for music with my education in software development.
- ðŸŒ± I'm working on an intensive full-time, six months software development bootcamp focusing on Python/Django development fundamentals and problem solving at Nashville Software School. I've already completed the client-side portion of the program which helped me gain more experience with JavaScript, CSS, and HTML. I have developed multiple REACT apps including the [WAX app](https://github.com/jmehart/wax). I'll be graduating in June of 2022 and I'm open to work as a software developer - feel free to reach out!
